# SF2 Web Application

The SF2 Web Application provides a user friendly web based interface through which information about samples and libraries to be processed can be submitted to Edinburgh Genomics by customers.  It also provides Edinburgh Genomics staff with web based interfaces for setting up projects, and for reviewing submissions, along with the ability to automatically upload the reviewed projects to a Clarity LIMS.
